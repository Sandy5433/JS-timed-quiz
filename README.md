# JavaScript Timed Quiz

## Description

For this week's project, the developer is required to build a timed quiz, featuring multiple choice questions on the topics of coding. This application runs in the browser, and aims to simulate coding assessment that developer is likely to encounter as part of an interview process. In the process of building this application, developer can familiarize themselves with the materials covered in the coursework and learn to apply these skills in real world problems.

You can access the application at https://github.com/Sandy5433/JS-timed-quiz

Your final score is the amount of time that is remaining at the end of the quiz. Once you have finished the quiz, you can submit your initial, which will take you to the high scores page where you can see how your score compare with will other contestants!.
